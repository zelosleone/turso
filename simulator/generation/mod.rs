/// Shadow trait for types that can be "shadowed" in the simulator environment.
/// Shadowing is a process of applying a transformation to the simulator environment
/// that reflects the changes made by the query or operation represented by the type.
/// The result of the shadowing is typically a vector of rows, which can be used to
/// update the simulator environment or to verify the correctness of the operation.
/// The `Result` type is used to indicate the type of the result of the shadowing
/// operation, which can vary depending on the type of the operation being shadowed.
/// For example, a `Create` operation might return an empty vector, while an `Insert` operation
/// might return a vector of rows that were inserted into the table.
