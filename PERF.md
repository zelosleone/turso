# Performance Testing

## Mobibench

1. Clone the source repository of Mobibench fork for Limbo:

```console
git clone git@github.com:penberg/Mobibench.git
```

2. Change `LIBS` in `shell/Makefile` to point to your Limbo source repository.

3. Build Mobibench:

```console
cd shell && make
```

4. Run Mobibench:

```console
./mobibench -p <benchmark-directory> -n 1000 -d 0 -j 4
```

## Clickbench

We have a modified version of the Clickbench benchmark script that can be run with:

```shell
make clickbench
```

This will build Limbo in release mode, create a database, and run the benchmarks with a small subset of the Clickbench dataset.
It will run the queries for both Limbo and SQLite, and print the results.



## Comparing VFS's/IO Back-ends (io_uring | syscall)

```shell
make bench-vfs SQL="select * from users;" N=500
```

The naive script will build and run limbo in release mode and execute the given SQL (against a copy of the `testing/testing.db` file)
`N` times with each `vfs`. This is not meant to be a definitive or thorough performance benchmark but serves to compare the two.


## TPC-H

1. Clone the Taratool TPC-H benchmarking tool:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:tarantool/tpch.git
```

2. Patch the benchmark runner script:

```patch
diff --git a/bench_queries.sh b/bench_queries.sh
index 6b894f9..c808e9a 100755
--- a/bench_queries.sh
